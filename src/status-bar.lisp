;;; in the call to finish-output for a number of seconds (10?  20?) if
;;; the alarm thread attempts to redraw the status bar while the other
;;; thread is doing output. I tried to use the output lock to protect
;;; access to the terminal, but perhaps I missed something (or that
;;; isn't the problem).
