Features:
* Playlists
-- Finish writing it! I.e. UI, Help, Playqueue interaction.
---- Suggested commands: queue stash/unstash, queue load, queue save. queue(s) list? or queue names? Build this into queue load somehow?
---- Support M3U import/export separately or impicitly perform in load/save?
------ I prefer implicitly. To do this, load should take a Playlist name *or* path.
-- M3U import/export should probably raise a condition or warn the user if it can't find a song, etc.
-- Is there a good way to rearrange song order in the playqueue at present?
* Last.fm/Scrobbling Support

Cleanup:
-- parse-and-execute in main is almost 300 lines now. Personally, I'd like to see these split up into lots of little functions.
---- Make sure not to lose error handling in the process.
-- print-commands should use introspection on DOCUMENTATION as far as I'm concerned.
---- How do we just get it for commands though? Maybe a defcommand macro with Syntax/Usage + Description.

Bugs:

Other:
* Vorbis support?
