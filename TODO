Features:
Remaining features: (2) implicit M3U import/export. (4) is hashing for 2.
(5) is build overhaul blocking 4. (6) is parse-and-execute and help cleanups. (7) is scrobbling and is blocked by 2 and 5.
(8) is having some append-only history to support "prev" track command. (9) PKGBUILD!
Schedule: 2+4 should be done by evening 08/06. 5 should be done by 08/13. 6 should be done by 08/20 and 7 by 09/01. 8 by 2012. :)
* Playlists
-- Make get-playlist lookup case-insensitive? Insertion via set-playlist should correspond...
-- Support M3U import/export separately or impicitly perform in load/save?
---- I prefer implicitly. To do this, load should take a Playlist name *or* path.
---- But prefpath fails to return a namestring when given a name with a file extension! :-/
---- As for save, set-playlist could call playlist-to-m3u before existing on each invocation.
---- ...but then we ought to hash the file to prevent repeat saves/disk writes of unmodified copy.
---- New format for *playlists* entries is: ((name . hash) . songs)
------ Do we use ironclad or just md5 for this?
------ We'll also need drakma for the scrobbling support, I expect. Makefiles should be overhauled and deploy tested.
-- Is there a good way to rearrange song order in the playqueue at present?
* Last.fm/Scrobbling Support

Cleanup:
-- parse-and-execute in main is almost 300 lines now. Personally, I'd like to see these split up into lots of little functions.
---- Make sure not to lose error handling in the process.
-- print-commands should use introspection via DOCUMENTATION as far as I'm concerned.
---- How do we just get it for commands though? Maybe a defcommand macro with Syntax/Usage + Description.
---- What useful patterns can we pull out into a defcommand macro? Playqueue commands etc?
-- We should clean up build-sbcl.lisp and either update/fix or remove the Makefile stuff+buildscripts for ccl.
---- Cleanup == fix (load "shuffletron.asd") + ccl stuff. Utilize quicklisp?
---- Can we have a single build.lisp file? All we really care is that people can git clone + make + make install.
------ Supporting install to prefixes other than /usr/local/ would also be great.
-- Should we depend on and use quicklisp? I think so.
---- You could even make a separate PKGBUILD for it a la leiningen but I'm dubious on the benefits.
