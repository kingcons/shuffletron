Features:
* Playlists
-- Finish writing it! I.e. UI, Help, Playqueue interaction.
---- Note: I've been storing playlists as Vectors. Playqueue is a list. Convert representation?
---- Switch to a hash table instead of assoc for *playlists*?
---- Suggested commands: queue stash/unstash, queue load, queue save.
---- Support M3U import/export separately or impicitly perform in load/save?
-- M3U import/export should probably raise a condition if it can't find a song, etc.
-- Is there a good way to rearrange song order in the playqueue at present?
* Last.fm/Scrobbling Support

Bugs:

Other:
* Vorbis support?
