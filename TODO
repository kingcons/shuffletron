Features:
* Playlists
-- Suggested commands: queue show $name?
---- Make get-playlist lookup case-insensitive? Insertion via set-playlist should correspond...
-- Support M3U import/export separately or impicitly perform in load/save?
---- I prefer implicitly. To do this, load should take a Playlist name *or* path.
---- But prefpath fails to return a namestring when given a name with a file extension! :-/
---- As for save, set-playlist could call playlist-to-m3u before existing on each invocation.
---- ...but then we ought to hash the file to prevent repeat saves/disk writes of unmodified copy.
-- M3U import should probably raise a condition or warn the user if it can't find a song, etc.
-- Is there a good way to rearrange song order in the playqueue at present?
* Last.fm/Scrobbling Support

Cleanup:
-- parse-and-execute in main is almost 300 lines now. Personally, I'd like to see these split up into lots of little functions.
---- Make sure not to lose error handling in the process.
-- print-commands should use introspection via DOCUMENTATION as far as I'm concerned.
---- How do we just get it for commands though? Maybe a defcommand macro with Syntax/Usage + Description.
---- What useful patterns can we pull out into a defcommand macro? Playqueue commands etc?

* Vorbis support?
